# About
This mod modifies Librarian villager trade factories so that all Enchantments
contained within Enchanted Books offered by Librarians will always be max level.

This applies to both vanilla and enchantments added by datapacks/mods,
assuming that the added enchantments are implemented correctly.

Existing trades that have been used at least once will not be affected,
only trades that generate from unemployed villagers that become Librarians,
or from Librarins that level up and offer new Enchanted Book trades.
